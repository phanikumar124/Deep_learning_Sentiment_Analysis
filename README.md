# Deep Learning Based Sentiment Analysis Web Application

##  Project Overview

This project implements a Deep Learning-based Sentiment Analysis system using a Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) network. The application classifies user reviews as **Positive** or **Negative** and also supports bulk CSV sentiment prediction through a Flask web interface.

The system is built using TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, and Flask.

##  Model Architecture

The deep learning model consists of:

- Embedding Layer (Vocabulary Size: 20,000)
- Bidirectional LSTM (64 units)
- Dense Layer (ReLU Activation)
- Output Layer (Sigmoid Activation)

**Training Configuration:**

- Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy  
- Optimizer: Adam (Learning rate = 0.001)  
- Validation Split: 20%  
- Epochs: 5  
- Batch Size: 64

## 🚀 Training the Model

Run the training script:

python train.py  

After training, the following files will be generated inside the `model/` directory:

- sentiment_model.h5  
- tokenizer.pkl  

---

## 🌐 Run the Web Application

Start the Flask application:

python app.py  

Open your browser and go to:

http://127.0.0.1:5000

## 📈 Example Prediction

Input:  
"I am very happy with this medicine."

Output:  
Sentiment: Positive  
Confidence: 0.91  

---

## 🧪 Dataset Information

The model is trained on a drug review dataset containing:

- User Reviews  
- Corresponding Ratings  

Sentiment Labeling Rule:
- Rating ≥ 7 → Positive  
- Rating < 7 → Negative  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Add Attention Mechanism  
- Increase Epochs for Better Accuracy  
- Deploy on Render / AWS  
- Add REST API Support  
- Dockerize the Application
